The domain is partitioned and the coupling is established in a Dirichlet-Neumann fashion.\n\n## Setup\n\nWe solve a partitioned heat equation. For information on the non-partitioned case, please refer to [1, p.37ff]. In this tutorial the computational domain is partitioned and coupled via preCICE. The coupling roughly follows the approach described in [2].\n\n![Case setup of partitioned-heat-conduction case](images/tutorials-partitioned-heat-conduction-setup.png)\n\nCase setup from [3]. `D` denotes the Dirichlet participant and `N` denotes the Neumann participant.\n\nThe heat equation is solved on a rectangular domain `Omega = [0,2] x [0,1]` with given Dirichlet boundary conditions. We split the domain at `x_c = 1` using a straight vertical line, the coupling interface. The left part of the domain will be referred to as the Dirichlet partition and the right part as the Neumann partition. To couple the two participants we use Dirichlet-Neumann coupling. Here, the Dirichlet participant receives Dirichlet boundary conditions (`Temperature`) at the coupling interface and solves the heat equation using these boundary conditions on the left part of the domain. Then the Dirichlet participant computes the resulting heat flux (`Flux`) from the solution and sends it to the Neumann participant. The Neumann participant uses the flux as a Neumann boundary condition to solve the heat equation on the right part of the domain. We then extract the temperature from the solution and send it back to the Dirichlet participant. This establishes the coupling between the two participants.\n\nThis simple case allows us to compare the solution for the partitioned case to a known analytical solution (method of manufactures solutions, see [1, p.37ff]). For more usage examples and details, please refer to [3, sect. 4.1].","metadata":{},"id":"f6ae8fe5-d7e0-4ce6-aa0b-d3ae2ce1129d"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import argparse\nimport numpy as np\nimport multiprocessing","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[],"id":"15fba919-6bf9-4b29-abd7-386eb81651f2"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from __future__ import print_function, division\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom fenics import Function, FunctionSpace, Expression, Constant, DirichletBC, TrialFunction, TestFunction, \\\n    File, solve, lhs, rhs, grad, inner, assemble, dot, dx, ds, project, sqrt, interpolate, VectorFunctionSpace, \\\n    MeshFunction, MPI, SubDomain, Point, RectangleMesh, near, Function, VectorFunctionSpace, Expression\nfrom fenicsprecice import Adapter\nimport dolfin\nfrom dolfin import FacetNormal, dot","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[],"id":"03b9d78d-87bf-4a80-b4d4-cf87bd1122db"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def run_precice(problem, domain_part):\n    mesh, coupling_boundary, remaining_boundary = get_geometry(domain_part)\n\n    # Define function space using mesh\n    V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 2)\n    V_g = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 1)\n    W = V_g.sub(0).collapse()\n\n    # Define boundary conditions\n    u_D = Expression('1 + x[0]*x[0] + alpha*x[1]*x[1] + beta*t', degree=2, alpha=alpha, beta=beta, t=0)\n    u_D_function = interpolate(u_D, V)\n\n    if problem is ProblemType.DIRICHLET:\n        # Define flux in x direction\n        f_N = Expression(\"2 * x[0]\", degree=1, alpha=alpha, t=0)\n        f_N_function = interpolate(f_N, W)\n\n    # Define initial value\n    u_n = interpolate(u_D, V)\n    u_n.rename(\"Temperature\", \"\")\n\n    precice, precice_dt, initial_data = None, 0.0, None\n\n    # Initialize the adapter according to the specific participant\n    if problem is ProblemType.DIRICHLET:\n        precice = Adapter(adapter_config_filename=\"/home/jovyan/fenics/precice-adapter-config-D.json\")\n        precice_dt = precice.initialize(coupling_boundary, read_function_space=V, write_object=f_N_function)\n    elif problem is ProblemType.NEUMANN:\n        precice = Adapter(adapter_config_filename=\"/home/jovyan/fenics/precice-adapter-config-N.json\")\n        precice_dt = precice.initialize(coupling_boundary, read_function_space=W, write_object=u_D_function)\n\n    dt = Constant(0)\n    dt.assign(np.min([fenics_dt, precice_dt]))\n\n    # Define variational problem\n    u = TrialFunction(V)\n    v = TestFunction(V)\n    f = Expression('beta - 2 - 2*alpha', degree=2, alpha=alpha, beta=beta, t=0)\n    F = u * v / dt * dx + dot(grad(u), grad(v)) * dx - (u_n / dt + f) * v * dx\n\n    bcs = [DirichletBC(V, u_D, remaining_boundary)]\n\n    # Set boundary conditions at coupling interface once wrt to the coupling\n    # expression\n    coupling_expression = precice.create_coupling_expression()\n    if problem is ProblemType.DIRICHLET:\n        # modify Dirichlet boundary condition on coupling interface\n        bcs.append(DirichletBC(V, coupling_expression, coupling_boundary))\n    if problem is ProblemType.NEUMANN:\n        # modify Neumann boundary condition on coupling interface, modify weak\n        # form correspondingly\n        F += v * coupling_expression * dolfin.ds\n\n    a, L = lhs(F), rhs(F)\n\n    # Time-stepping\n    u_np1 = Function(V)\n    u_np1.rename(\"Temperature\", \"\")\n    t = 0\n\n    # reference solution at t=0\n    u_ref = interpolate(u_D, V)\n    u_ref.rename(\"reference\", \" \")\n\n    # mark mesh w.r.t ranks\n    mesh_rank = MeshFunction(\"size_t\", mesh, mesh.topology().dim())\n    if problem is ProblemType.NEUMANN:\n        mesh_rank.set_all(MPI.rank(MPI.comm_world) + 4)\n    else:\n        mesh_rank.set_all(MPI.rank(MPI.comm_world) + 0)\n    mesh_rank.rename(\"myRank\", \"\")\n\n    # Generating output files\n    temperature_out = File(\"out/%s.pvd\" % precice.get_participant_name())\n    ref_out = File(\"out/ref%s.pvd\" % precice.get_participant_name())\n    error_out = File(\"out/error%s.pvd\" % precice.get_participant_name())\n    ranks = File(\"out/ranks%s.pvd\" % precice.get_participant_name())\n\n    # output solution and reference solution at t=0, n=0\n    n = 0\n    print('output u^%d and u_ref^%d' % (n, n))\n    temperature_out << u_n\n    ref_out << u_ref\n    ranks << mesh_rank\n\n    error_total, error_pointwise = compute_errors(u_n, u_ref, V)\n    error_out << error_pointwise\n\n    # set t_1 = t_0 + dt, this gives u_D^1\n    # call dt(0) to evaluate FEniCS Constant.
