The domain is partitioned and the coupling is established in a Dirichlet-Neumann fashion.\n\n## Setup\n\nWe solve a partitioned heat equation. For information on the non-partitioned case, please refer to [1, p.37ff]. In this tutorial the computational domain is partitioned and coupled via preCICE. The coupling roughly follows the approach described in [2].\n\n![Case setup of partitioned-heat-conduction case](images/tutorials-partitioned-heat-conduction-setup.png)\n\nCase setup from [3]. `D` denotes the Dirichlet participant and `N` denotes the Neumann participant.\n\nThe heat equation is solved on a rectangular domain `Omega = [0,2] x [0,1]` with given Dirichlet boundary conditions. We split the domain at `x_c = 1` using a straight vertical line, the coupling interface. The left part of the domain will be referred to as the Dirichlet partition and the right part as the Neumann partition. To couple the two participants we use Dirichlet-Neumann coupling. Here, the Dirichlet participant receives Dirichlet boundary conditions (`Temperature`) at the coupling interface and solves the heat equation using these boundary conditions on the left part of the domain. Then the Dirichlet participant computes the resulting heat flux (`Flux`) from the solution and sends it to the Neumann participant. The Neumann participant uses the flux as a Neumann boundary condition to solve the heat equation on the right part of the domain. We then extract the temperature from the solution and send it back to the Dirichlet participant. This establishes the coupling between the two participants.\n\nThis simple case allows us to compare the solution for the partitioned case to a known analytical solution (method of manufactures solutions, see [1, p.37ff]). For more usage examples and details, please refer to [3, sect. 4.1].","metadata":{},"id":"f6ae8fe5-d7e0-4ce6-aa0b-d3ae2ce1129d"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from subprocess import Popen, PIPE","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[],"id":"0f46f1dc-35e9-4fcc-b71c-4cbd5912eb88"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"process_1 = Popen(\n    [\n        \"python3\", \n        \"heat.py\", \n        \"-d\", \n        \"--error-tol\", \n        \"10e-3\"\n    ], \n    stdout=PIPE, \n    stderr=PIPE, \n    cwd=\"fenics\", \n    universal_newlines=True\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[],"id":"13aab829-6db2-4736-80ab-138532a9787e"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"process_2 = Popen(\n    [\n        \"python3\", \n        \"heat.py\", \n        \"-n\", \n        \"--error-tol\", \n        \"10e-3\"\n    ], \n    stdout=PIPE, \n    stderr=PIPE, \n    cwd=\"fenics\", \n    universal_newlines=True\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[],"id":"5f04b77d-7398-473f-a003-459f0f5f4267"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"stdout, stderr = process_1.communicate()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[],"id":"b8e2e3d5-bd4c-4630-8e55-eae2d980fa84"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"stdout.split('\\n')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"execution_count":5,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"['---[precice] \\x1b[0m This is preCICE version 2.3.0',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Revision info: no-info [Git failed/Not a repository]',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Configuration: Debug',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Configuring preCICE with configuration \"/home/jovyan/fenics/../precice-config.xml\"',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m I am participant \"Dirichlet\"',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Setting up master communication to coupling partner/s',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Masters are connected',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Setting up preliminary slaves communication to coupling partner/s',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Prepare partition for mesh Dirichlet-Mesh',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Gather mesh Dirichlet-Mesh',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Send global mesh Dirichlet-Mesh',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Receive global mesh Neumann-Mesh',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Setting up slaves communication to coupling partner/s',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Slaves are connected',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m iteration: 1 of 100, time-window: 1, time: 0 of 1, time-window-size: 0.1, max-timestep-length: 0.1, ongoing: yes, time-window-complete: no, write-iteration-checkpoint ',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Compute \"read\" mapping from mesh \"Neumann-Mesh\" to mesh \"Dirichlet-Mesh\".',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Using tree-based preallocation for matrix C',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Using tree-based preallocation for matrix A',\n '---[precice] \\x1b[0m Using rescaling.
